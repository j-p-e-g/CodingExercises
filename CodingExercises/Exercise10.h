//Write a program that is able to compute some operations on an integer.The program writes the value of the integer and writes the following menu :
//
//1. Add 1
//2. Multiply by 2
//3. Subtract 4
//4. Quit
//
//The programs ask the user to type a value between 1 and 4. If the user types a value from 1 to 3 the operation is computed, the integer is written and the menu is displayed again.If the user types 4, the program quits.
